<h1>Partrick Young</h1>

<p> I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.

Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycleâ€”from initial product conception through the actual product launch.

<p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
<p>At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.

<p>In my spare time, I participate in a variety of activities including:</p>

 <li><p><a href="http://www.sk8stuff.com/">Freestyle Figure Skating</a></p></li>
 <li><p> Keeping Molly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn_Terrier">Cairn Terrier,</a> out of trouble.
